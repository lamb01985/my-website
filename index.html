    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm currently attending Hack Reactor, where I'm learning Python, JavaScript, SQL, and much more. The curriculum is rigorous, but I'm loving building and learning. I'm also learning how to build build websites (like this one!) using HTML and CSS. Prior to this, I spent the last 10 years leading Talent Programs for tech companies of all stages, series A to public. I am a seasoned Technical Recruiter, people and program leader, as well as a USAF Veteran.</p>
